# LangGraph Memory Store & Long-term Memory - 2025 Search Results

## Key Findings

Based on the search results, here's what I found about LangGraph's memory store and long-term memory capabilities in 2025:

### **Memory Architecture Overview**

LangGraph implements a **dual memory system**:

1. **Short-term Memory**: Limited to individual conversation threads
2. **Long-term Memory**: Cross-session, application-level data storage

### **Long-term Memory Features**

- **Store Implementation**: Long-term memory is implemented through a `Store` component that:
  - Works independently from Checkpointer
  - Can be used even without Checkpointer
  - Allows cross-thread memory sharing
  - Supports custom namespaces (not just single-thread scoped)

- **Capabilities**:
  - Stores and retrieves semantic facts
  - Maintains episodic experiences
  - Stores updateable rules
  - Persists across different conversations/sessions
  - Can be accessed at any time from any thread

### **Integration Patterns**

The search results mention several integration approaches:
- **Redis Integration**: Combining LangGraph workflows with Redis for powerful memory capabilities
- **Milvus Integration**: Building production-ready agents with real long-term memory
- **Custom Storage**: Store allows flexible namespace-based memory organization

### **Recent Developments (2025)**

The search shows several articles published in late 2025 (November-December 2025), indicating active development and documentation around:
- Memory management best practices
- Feedback loops and dynamic prompts for continuous AI learning
- Production-ready implementation patterns

### **Resources**

Key documentation sources include:
- [LangGraph Memory Documentation](https://langgraph.com.cn/agents/memory/index.html)
- GitHub LangChain documentation
- Multiple technical articles and tutorials

Would you like me to search for more specific information about any particular aspect of LangGraph's memory system?
