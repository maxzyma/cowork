Web search results for query: "Haystack RAG framework memory 2025"

I'll perform a web search for "Haystack RAG framework memory 2025" for you.

Links: [{}]

I encountered an error when trying to perform the web search. The API returned a 429 error indicating:

**Error Message:** "您当前使用该API的并发数过高，请降低并发，或联系客服增加限额。"
**Translation:** "Your current concurrent usage of this API is too high. Please reduce concurrency or contact customer service to increase the quota."

This error occurs when there are too many simultaneous requests being made to the search API. 

**Suggestions:**
1. Try the search again in a moment
2. If you're making multiple searches, try spacing them out
3. If you need to make frequent searches, you may need to contact the service provider to increase your API quota

Would you like me to try the search again, or is there anything else I can help you with?
