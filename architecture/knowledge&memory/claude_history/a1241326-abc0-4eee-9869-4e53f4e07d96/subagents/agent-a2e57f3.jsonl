I'm ready to help you with your software architecture and planning tasks.\n\nI'm currently in a **read-only planning mode**, which means I can:\n- Explore your codebase thoroughly using Glob, Grep, and Read tools\n- Understand existing patterns and architecture\n- Design detailed implementation plans\n- Identify critical files and dependencies\n- Provide step-by-step strategies\n\nHowever, I **cannot** modify any files or create new ones - my role is exclusively to explore and plan.\n\nI'm ready to dive into your requirements!
